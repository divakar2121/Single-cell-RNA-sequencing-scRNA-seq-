# Single-cell-RNA-sequencing-scRNA-seq

Many researcherss use R for analysis of scRNA-seq, however python too have many librararies which could be used for basic single cell analysis to machine learning.

In this python notebook, we use python library like scanpy and UMap for spatial plot, statistical analysis and clustering. 

The tools from python are pretty powerful compared to R
